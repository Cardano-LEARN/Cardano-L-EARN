#### Learning Tree

Our educational material is organized in a tree like structure. The tree has learning categories, or "branches", and lessons, or "leafs". We call this the learning tree.

##### Lesson codes
Lessons are named by letter codes. The letter codes represent a branch on the learning tree

For example:
```
L: Learn and Earn
LC: Learn and Earn - Cardano
LCS: Learn and Earn - Cardano - Smart Contracts
```
Each branch has its lessons, or leafs.  For example, the branch LC: Learn and Earn - Cryptocurrency, has:
```
LC1: Intro_To_Cardano
LC2: Decentralized_Applications
LC3: Cold_Storage
```
and so on. Every lesson has a place on the learning tree and is known by a lesson code.

#### Learning Paths

A learning path is a list of lessons taken from the learning tree, that is geared towards a particular learning outcome. Learning paths are basically equivalent to short courses.

Anyone can create learning paths and share with others. Students are also free to follow their own personal learning paths, and skip over lessons they know if desired.
