### Learning
Learning about Cardano is Cardano L-EARN's primary focus. In this section you will learn what topics we offer, how lessons are structured, and about learning trees and learning paths.

#### Topics

We offer a small core of general lessons for beginners, and an expanded set of lessons for developers.

There are also a small number of lessons involving the Cardano L-EARN platform itself, including this lesson.

#### Open Source
All lessons are open source and available in this Github repository and free for anyone.

#### Peer to Peer
We use peer to peer learning and teaching, and even testing.

### Earning
Earning DOT is the second aspect of Cardano L-EARN. In this section you will learn how to Earn DOT.


#### Passing Tests
Every lesson comes with a test, including this lesson. You must pass that test to earn the reward.

You can take as many tests as you want to accumulate rewards.  

Rewards are always in DOT!

#### Verification

Verification is required to prevent Sybil attacks, that is individuals claiming multiple identities and multiple rewards.  

There are 2 ways to get verified on Cardano L-EARN.
 - [get verified on BrightID](https://brightid.gitbook.io/brightid/getting-verified)
 - Get verified directly with a trusted community member.

You may accumulate earnings before verifying, but verification is required to withdraw rewards.

We try to make it as easy as possible to get verified, while remaining resistant to sybil attacks.
