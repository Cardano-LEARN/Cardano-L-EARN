# Getting Started With Cardano L-EARN

Welcome! This lesson provides instructions on learning and earning with Cardano L-EARN.

We are a Cardano community project where you can learn about Cardano and Earn ADA at the same time. Learning is peer to peer, and open source. Our goal is to train people with Cardano skills, provide you with ADA income, and increase Cardano adoption!

Read this lesson, take notes, and talk to a testing official at the end. You can earn 2 ADA at the end.

## Theory
Study this section to understand what Cardano L-EARN is all about

### Learning
Learning about Cardano is Cardano L-EARN's primary focus. In this section you will learn what topics we offer, how lessons are structured, and about learning trees and learning paths.

#### Topics

We offer a small core of general lessons for beginners, and an expanded set of lessons for developers.

There are also a small number of lessons involving the Cardano L-EARN platform itself, including this lesson.

#### Open Source
All lessons are open source and available in this Github repository and free for anyone.

#### Peer to Peer
We use peer to peer learning and teaching, and even testing.

Community members can become testers after going through an approval process

### Earning
Earning ADA is the second aspect of Cardano L-EARN. In this section you will learn how to Earn ADA.

#### Passing Tests
Every lesson comes with a test. For this lesson, the test will just be a few yes/no questions confirming you understood the key points.

You can take as many tests as you want to accumulate rewards.  

Rewards are always in ADA!


#### Verification
Verification is required to prevent Sybil attacks, that is individuals claiming multiple identities and multiple rewards.  

There are 2 ways to get verified on Polkadot L-EARN.
 - [get verified on BrightID](https://brightid.gitbook.io/brightid/getting-verified)
 - Get verified directly with a trusted community member.

You may earn before verifying, but verification is required to withdraw rewards.

We try to make it as easy as possible to get verified, while remaining resistant to sybil attacks.
